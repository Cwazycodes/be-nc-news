# Northcoders News API

To successfully connect to the datatbases two .env files must be created. 

- Create two .env files called .env.test. and .env.development.
- In each file you will need add PGDATABASE= and the relevant database to connect to.
    - The databases are nc_news_test and nc_news.

Therefore the .env.test file should contain:
    PGDATABASE=nc_news_test

and the .env.development file should contain:
    PGDATABASE=nc_news
